	* Version 0.2
	NVML now consists of six libraries:
		- libpmem                            (basic flushing, etc)
		- libpmemblk, libpmemlog, libpmemobj (transactions)
		- libvmem, libvmmalloc               (volatile use of pmem)
	The "pmempool" command is available for managing pmem files.
	Man pages for all the above are complete.
	The only things documented in man pages but not implemented are:
		- pmem sets (ability to spread a pool over a set of files)
		- replication (coming for libpmemobj)
	The pmempool command does not yet support pmemobj type pools.
