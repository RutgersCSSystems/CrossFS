Linux NVM Library

This is doc/README.

This directory contains the man pages for the NVM Library:

libpmem.3 -- libpmem(3) - persistent memory library
libvmem.3 -- libvmem(3) - volatile memory allocation library

These man pages provide the API specification for the corresponding
libraries in this source tree, so any updates to one should be tested,
reviewed, and committed with changes to the other.

To create more readable text files from the source, use:
	$ make
An even more convenient way to read these is to use the "man"
command to format them (includes bold, underline, etc. when
run in a terminal window):
	$ man -l libpmem.3
	$ man -l libvmem.3
