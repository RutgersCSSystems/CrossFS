This is src/test/pmem_clflush_proc/README.

This directory contains a unit test for the pmem clflush/clflushopt checks.

The program in pmem_clflush_proc.c takes a fake /proc/cpuinfo file via
the environment variable "PFILE".  It arranges for libpmem to open the
fake /proc file.

	usage: PFILE=cpuinfo-file pmem_clflush_proc
