The Hoard memory allocator is a fast, scalable, and memory-efficient
memory allocator for Linux, Solaris, Mac OS X, and Windows. Hoard is a
drop-in replacement for malloc that can dramatically improve
application performance, especially for multithreaded programs running
on multiprocessors and multicore CPUs. No source code changes
necessary: just link it in or set one environment variable (see below).

Press
-----

"If you'll be running on multiprocessor machines, ... use Emery
Berger's excellent Hoard multiprocessor memory management code. It's a
drop-in replacement for the C and C++ memory routines and is very fast
on multiprocessor machines."

 -- Debugging Applications for Microsoft .NET and Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Press

"(To improve scalability), consider an open source alternative such as
the Hoard Memory Manager..."

 -- Windows System Programming, Addison-Wesley

"Hoard dramatically improves program performance through its more
efficient use of memory. Moreover, Hoard has provably bounded memory
blowup and low synchronization costs."

 --  Principles of Parallel Programming, Addison-Wesley

Users

Companies using Hoard in their products and servers include AOL,
British Telecom, Blue Vector, Business Objects (formerly Crystal
Decisions), Cisco, Credit Suisse, Entrust, InfoVista, Kamakura,
Novell, Oktal SE, OpenText, OpenWave Systems (for their Typhoon and
Twister servers), Pervasive Software, Plath GmbH, Quest Software,
Reuters, Royal Bank of Canada, SAP, Sonus Networks, Tata
Communications, and Verite Group.

Open source projects using Hoard include the Asterisk Open Source
Telephony Project, Bayonne GNU telephony server, the Cilk parallel
programming language, the GNU Common C++ system, the OpenFOAM
computational fluid dynamics toolkit, and the SafeSquid web proxy.

Hoard is now a standard compiler option for the Standard Performance
Evaluation Corporation's CPU2006 benchmark suite for the Intel and
Open64 compilers.

Hoard is also included with some Linux distributions, including
Mandriva and Debian.

Why Hoard?
----------

There are a number of problems with existing memory allocators that
make Hoard a better choice.

-- Contention --

Multithreaded programs often do not scale because the heap is a
bottleneck. When multiple threads simultaneously allocate or
deallocate memory from the allocator, the allocator will serialize
them. Programs making intensive use of the allocator actually slow
down as the number of processors increases. Your program may be
allocation-intensive without you realizing it, for instance, if your
program makes many calls to the C++ Standard Template Library (STL).

-- False Sharing --

The allocator can cause other problems for multithreaded code. It can
lead to false sharing in your application: threads on different CPUs
can end up with memory in the same cache line, or chunk of
memory. Accessing these falsely-shared cache lines is hundreds of
times slower than accessing unshared cache lines.

-- Blowup --

Multithreaded programs can also lead the allocator to blowup memory
consumption. This effect can multiply the amount of memory needed to
run your application by the number of CPUs on your machine: four CPUs
could mean that you need four times as much memory. Hoard is a fast
allocator that solves all of these problems.

Technical Information
---------------------

For technical details of a previous version of Hoard, read "Hoard: A
Scalable Memory Allocator for Multithreaded Applications", by Emery
D. Berger, Kathryn S. McKinley, Robert D. Blumofe, and Paul
R. Wilson. The Ninth International Conference on Architectural Support
for Programming Languages and Operating Systems
(ASPLOS-IX). Cambridge, MA, November 2000.


Building Hoard (Unix/Mac)
-------------------------

To build Hoard on non-Windows platforms, change into the src/
directory and run "make" followed by the appropriate target. If you
type "make", it will present a list of available targets. These
include linux-gcc-x86, solaris-sunw-sparc, etc.

You can then use Hoard by linking it with your executable, or
by setting the LD_PRELOAD environment variable, as in

  % export LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/libhoard.so

in Solaris:

  % export LD_PRELOAD="/path/to/libhoard_32.so:/usr/lib/libCrun.so.1"
  (32-bit version)

  % export LD_PRELOAD="/path/to/libhoard_64.so:/usr/lib/64/libCrun.so.1"
  (64-bit version)

or, in Mac OS X:

  % export DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=/path/to/libhoard.dylib

Building Hoard (Windows)
------------------------

Change into the src directory and type "nmake windows", as in:

  C:\hoard\src> nmake windows

To use Hoard, link your executable with 'source\uselibhoard.cpp' and 'winhoard.lib'.
You *must* use the /MD flag.

Example:
  C:\hoard\src> cl /Ox /MD yourapp.cpp source\uselibhoard.cpp libhoard.lib

To run yourapp.exe, you will need to have libhoard.dll in your path.


Benchmarks
----------

The directory benchmarks/ contains a number of benchmarks used to
evaluate and tune Hoard.
