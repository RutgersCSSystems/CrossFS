This directory contains all source code required to build Hoard.

heaplayers/  - Heap Layers (heaplayers.org), an infrastructure for building memory allocators
include/     - all Hoard-specific header files (the bulk of Hoard's functionality)
source/      - all .cpp files required to use Hoard

** Building Hoard: **

To compile Hoard on any platform, use "make" (or on Windows, "nmake").
Just type

     make

to see all possible options.

** Using Hoard with Windows: **

First, build the libhoard.dll ("nmake windows").
Then, link your executable with 'source\uselibhoard.cpp' and 'libhoard.lib'.
You must use the /MD flag.

Example:
  C:\hoard\src> cl /Ox /MD yourapp.cpp source\uselibhoard.cpp libhoard.lib

To run yourapp.exe, you will need to have libhoard.dll in your path.


** Using Hoard with other systems: **

You can use Hoard by linking it with your executable, or by setting a
single environment variable. For UNIX systems, this is the LD_PRELOAD
environment variable:

  % export LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/libhoard.so

in Solaris:

  % export LD_PRELOAD="/path/to/libhoard_32.so:/usr/lib/libCrun.so.1"
  (32-bit version)

  % export LD_PRELOAD="/path/to/libhoard_64.so:/usr/lib/64/libCrun.so.1"
  (64-bit version)

in Mac OS X, use DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES.

  % export DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=/path/to/libhoard.dylib
