 * pmem_inline.h -- inline versions of pmem for performance
 *
 * If your program is so latency sensitive that the overhead of
 * function calls need to be optimized out, include this file
 * instead of pmem.h.  Of course, the downside is that the pmem
 * library functions will then be compiled into your program so
 * if the pmem library gets updated, your program will have to be
 * recompiled to use the updates.
 *
 * This inlined version only contains the cache-line version of
 * the pmem interfaces (not the "msync mode" or "fault injection
 * test mode" interfaces available with the full libpmem.
