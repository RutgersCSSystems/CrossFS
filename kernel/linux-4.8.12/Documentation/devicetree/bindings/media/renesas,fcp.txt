Renesas R-Car Frame Compression Processor (FCP)
-----------------------------------------------

The FCP is a companion module of video processing modules in the Renesas R-Car
Gen3 SoCs. It provides data compression and decompression, data caching, and
conversion of AXI transactions in order to reduce the memory bandwidth.

There are three types of FCP: FCP for Codec (FCPC), FCP for VSP (FCPV) and FCP
for FDP (FCPF). Their configuration and behaviour depend on the module they
are paired with. These DT bindings currently support the FCPV only.

 - compatible: Must be one or more of the following

   - "renesas,r8a7795-fcpv" for R8A7795 (R-Car H3) compatible 'FCP for VSP'
   - "renesas,fcpv" for generic compatible 'FCP for VSP'

   When compatible with the generic version, nodes must list the
   SoC-specific version corresponding to the platform first, followed by the
   family-specific and/or generic versions.

 - reg: the register base and size for the device registers
 - clocks: Reference to the functional clock


Device node example
-------------------

	fcpvd1: fcp@fea2f000 {
		compatible = "renesas,r8a7795-fcpv", "renesas,fcpv";
		reg = <0 0xfea2f000 0 0x200>;
		clocks = <&cpg CPG_MOD 602>;
	};
