this ioctl call restores the power to the bus. The call requires
read/write access to the device. This call has no effect if the device
is manually powered off. Not all DVB adapters support this ioctl.

On success 0 is returned, on error -1 and the ``errno`` variable is set
appropriately. The generic error codes are described at the
:ref:`Generic Error Codes <gen-errors>` chapter.
