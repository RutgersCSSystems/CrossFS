.. _FE_READ_STATUS:

********************
ioctl FE_READ_STATUS
********************

Name
====

FE_READ_STATUS - Returns status information about the front-end. This call only requires - read-only access to the device


Synopsis
========

.. cpp:function:: int ioctl( int fd, int request, unsigned int *status )


Arguments
=========

``fd``
    File descriptor returned by :ref:`open() <frontend_f_open>`.

``request``
    FE_READ_STATUS

``status``
    pointer to a bitmask integer filled with the values defined by enum
    :ref:`fe_status <fe-status>`.


Description
===========

All DVB frontend devices support the ``FE_READ_STATUS`` ioctl. It is
used to check about the locking status of the frontend after being
tuned. The ioctl takes a pointer to an integer where the status will be
written.

.. note:: The size of status is actually sizeof(enum fe_status), with
   varies according with the architecture. This needs to be fixed in the
   future.


.. _fe-status-t:

int fe_status
=============

The fe_status parameter is used to indicate the current state and/or
state changes of the frontend hardware. It is produced using the enum
:ref:`fe_status <fe-status>` values on a bitmask

       -  .. _FE-REINIT:

	  ``FE_REINIT``

       -  The frontend was reinitialized, application is recommended to

Return Value
============

On success 0 is returned, on error -1 and the ``errno`` variable is set
appropriately. The generic error codes are described at the
:ref:`Generic Error Codes <gen-errors>` chapter.
