VIDIOC_G_DV_TIMINGS - VIDIOC_S_DV_TIMINGS - VIDIOC_SUBDEV_G_DV_TIMINGS - VIDIOC_SUBDEV_S_DV_TIMINGS - Get or set DV timings for input or output


Synopsis
========

.. cpp:function:: int ioctl( int fd, int request, struct v4l2_dv_timings *argp )


Arguments
=========

``fd``
    File descriptor returned by :ref:`open() <func-open>`.

``request``
    VIDIOC_G_DV_TIMINGS, VIDIOC_S_DV_TIMINGS,
    VIDIOC_SUBDEV_G_DV_TIMINGS, VIDIOC_SUBDEV_S_DV_TIMINGS

``argp``


Description
===========

To set DV timings for the input or output, applications use the
:ref:`VIDIOC_S_DV_TIMINGS <VIDIOC_G_DV_TIMINGS>` ioctl and to get the current timings,
applications use the :ref:`VIDIOC_G_DV_TIMINGS <VIDIOC_G_DV_TIMINGS>` ioctl. The detailed timing
information is filled in using the structure struct
:ref:`v4l2_dv_timings <v4l2-dv-timings>`. These ioctls take a
pointer to the struct :ref:`v4l2_dv_timings <v4l2-dv-timings>`
structure as argument. If the ioctl is not supported or the timing
values are not correct, the driver returns ``EINVAL`` error code.

The ``linux/v4l2-dv-timings.h`` header can be used to get the timings of
the formats in the :ref:`cea861` and :ref:`vesadmt` standards. If
the current input or output does not support DV timings (e.g. if
:ref:`VIDIOC_ENUMINPUT` does not set the
``V4L2_IN_CAP_DV_TIMINGS`` flag), then ``ENODATA`` error code is returned.


Return Value
============

On success 0 is returned, on error -1 and the ``errno`` variable is set
appropriately. The generic error codes are described at the
:ref:`Generic Error Codes <gen-errors>` chapter.

EINVAL
    This ioctl is not supported, or the :ref:`VIDIOC_S_DV_TIMINGS <VIDIOC_G_DV_TIMINGS>`
    parameter was unsuitable.

ENODATA
    Digital video timings are not supported for this input or output.

EBUSY
    The device is busy and therefore can not change the timings.

    -  .. row 2

       -  __u32

       -  ``height``

       -  Height of the active video frame in lines. So for interlaced
	  formats the height of the active video in each field is

       -  ``polarities``

       -  This is a bit mask that defines polarities of sync signals. bit 0
	  (``V4L2_DV_VSYNC_POS_POL``) is for vertical sync polarity and bit
	  1 (``V4L2_DV_HSYNC_POS_POL``) is for horizontal sync polarity. If
	  the bit is set (1) it is positive polarity and if is cleared (0),
	  it is negative polarity.

       -

    -  .. row 3

       -  ``V4L2_DV_FL_REDUCED_BLANKING``

       -  CVT/GTF specific: the timings use reduced blanking (CVT) or the
	  'Secondary GTF' curve (GTF). In both cases the horizontal and/or
	  vertical blanking intervals are reduced, allowing a higher
	  resolution over the same bandwidth. This is a read-only flag,
	  applications must not set this.

    -  .. row 4

       -  ``V4L2_DV_FL_CAN_REDUCE_FPS``

       -  CEA-861 specific: set for CEA-861 formats with a framerate that is
	  a multiple of six. These formats can be optionally played at 1 /
	  1.001 speed to be compatible with 60 Hz based standards such as
	  NTSC and PAL-M that use a framerate of 29.97 frames per second. If
	  the transmitter can't generate such frequencies, then the flag
	  will also be cleared. This is a read-only flag, applications must
	  not set this.

    -  .. row 5

       -  ``V4L2_DV_FL_REDUCED_FPS``

       -  CEA-861 specific: only valid for video transmitters, the flag is
	  cleared by receivers. It is also only valid for formats with the
	  ``V4L2_DV_FL_CAN_REDUCE_FPS`` flag set, for other formats the
	  flag will be cleared by the driver. If the application sets this
	  flag, then the pixelclock used to set up the transmitter is
	  divided by 1.001 to make it compatible with NTSC framerates. If
	  the transmitter can't generate such frequencies, then the flag
	  will also be cleared.

    -  .. row 6

       -  ``V4L2_DV_FL_HALF_LINE``

       -  Specific to interlaced formats: if set, then the vertical
	  frontporch of field 1 (aka the odd field) is really one half-line
	  longer and the vertical backporch of field 2 (aka the even field)
	  is really one half-line shorter, so each field has exactly the
	  same number of half-lines. Whether half-lines can be detected or
	  used depends on the hardware.

    -  .. row 7

       -  ``V4L2_DV_FL_IS_CE_VIDEO``

       -  If set, then this is a Consumer Electronics (CE) video format.
	  Such formats differ from other formats (commonly called IT
	  formats) in that if R'G'B' encoding is used then by default the
	  R'G'B' values use limited range (i.e. 16-235) as opposed to full
	  range (i.e. 0-255). All formats defined in CEA-861 except for the
	  640x480p59.94 format are CE formats.
