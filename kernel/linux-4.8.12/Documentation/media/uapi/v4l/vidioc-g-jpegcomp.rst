******************************************
ioctl VIDIOC_G_JPEGCOMP, VIDIOC_S_JPEGCOMP
******************************************

Name
====

VIDIOC_G_JPEGCOMP - VIDIOC_S_JPEGCOMP


Synopsis
========

.. cpp:function:: int ioctl( int fd, int request, v4l2_jpegcompression *argp )

.. cpp:function:: int ioctl( int fd, int request, const v4l2_jpegcompression *argp )


Arguments
=========

``fd``
    File descriptor returned by :ref:`open() <func-open>`.

``request``
    VIDIOC_G_JPEGCOMP, VIDIOC_S_JPEGCOMP

``argp``


Description
===========

These ioctls are **deprecated**. New drivers and applications should use
:ref:`JPEG class controls <jpeg-controls>` for image quality and JPEG
markers control.

[to do]

Ronald Bultje elaborates:

APP is some application-specific information. The application can set it
itself, and it'll be stored in the JPEG-encoded fields (eg; interlacing
information for in an AVI or so). COM is the same, but it's comments,
like 'encoded by me' or so.

jpeg_markers describes whether the huffman tables, quantization tables
and the restart interval information (all JPEG-specific stuff) should be
stored in the JPEG-encoded fields. These define how the JPEG field is
encoded. If you omit them, applications assume you've used standard
encoding. You usually do want to add them.

Return Value
============

On success 0 is returned, on error -1 and the ``errno`` variable is set
appropriately. The generic error codes are described at the
:ref:`Generic Error Codes <gen-errors>` chapter.
