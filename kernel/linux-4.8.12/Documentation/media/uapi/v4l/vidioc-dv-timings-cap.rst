Name
====

VIDIOC_DV_TIMINGS_CAP - VIDIOC_SUBDEV_DV_TIMINGS_CAP - The capabilities of the Digital Video receiver/transmitter


Synopsis
========

.. cpp:function:: int ioctl( int fd, int request, struct v4l2_dv_timings_cap *argp )


Arguments
=========

``fd``
    File descriptor returned by :ref:`open() <func-open>`.

``request``
    VIDIOC_DV_TIMINGS_CAP, VIDIOC_SUBDEV_DV_TIMINGS_CAP

``argp``


Description
===========

To query the capabilities of the DV receiver/transmitter applications
initialize the ``pad`` field to 0, zero the reserved array of struct
:ref:`v4l2_dv_timings_cap <v4l2-dv-timings-cap>` and call the
``VIDIOC_DV_TIMINGS_CAP`` ioctl on a video node and the driver will fill
in the structure.

.. note:: Drivers may return different values after
   switching the video input or output.

When implemented by the driver DV capabilities of subdevices can be
queried by calling the ``VIDIOC_SUBDEV_DV_TIMINGS_CAP`` ioctl directly
on a subdevice node. The capabilities are specific to inputs (for DV
receivers) or outputs (for DV transmitters), applications must specify
the desired pad number in the struct
:ref:`v4l2_dv_timings_cap <v4l2-dv-timings-cap>` ``pad`` field and
zero the ``reserved`` array. Attempts to query capabilities on a pad
that doesn't support them will return an ``EINVAL`` error code.
