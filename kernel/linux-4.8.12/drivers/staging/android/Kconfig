config ASHMEM
	bool "Enable the Anonymous Shared Memory Subsystem"
	default n
	depends on SHMEM
	---help---
	  The ashmem subsystem is a new shared memory allocator, similar to
	  POSIX SHM but with different behavior and sporting a simpler
	  file-based API.

	  It is, in theory, a good memory allocator for low-memory devices,
	  because it can discard shared memory units when under memory pressure.

config ANDROID_LOW_MEMORY_KILLER
	bool "Android Low Memory Killer"
	---help---
	  Registers processes to be killed when low memory conditions, this is useful
	  as there is no particular swap space on android.

	  The registered process will kill according to the priorities in android init
	  scripts (/init.rc), and it defines priority values with minimum free memory size
	  for each priority.

config SW_SYNC
	bool "Software synchronization framework"
	default n
	depends on SYNC_FILE
	depends on DEBUG_FS
	---help---
	  A sync object driver that uses a 32bit counter to coordinate
	  synchronization.  Useful when there is no hardware primitive backing
	  the synchronization.

	  WARNING: improper use of this can result in deadlocking kernel
	  drivers from userspace. Intended for test and debug only.
